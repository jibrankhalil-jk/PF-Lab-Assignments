# Task 4

### Question 1

    1. An electronics company sells circuit boards at 20% profit. Write a program that will calculate the selling price of a circuit board that costs X R.s. Display the original price of board, selling price, and the profit earned on the screen. Do the task using a function that accepts the original price as an argument, and does not return anything, and prints the selling price and profit on screen.

### Question 2

    2. Alice received her electricity bill for the month of September. The previous electricity units of Alice bill were X units and the present units were Y units. The X or previous units is the cumulative units for the month August and all previous months. Similarly, Y or present units is the cumulative units consumed in September plus all previous months (September, August, .........). Calculate the units consumed in the month of September and also calculate the total bill. Your program should print the units consumed in September and the total bill for September. 1 unit price= 5 Rs. Take this as a global const variable. Make a function that takes two arguments, previous units, and present units, and return the bill for the month of September. Print the units consumed within the function.
